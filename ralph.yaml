    ## Your task
    1. Read stories.yaml
    2. Read progress.md
    3. Pick the story where `passes: false` with lowest `priority`, then lowest US number
    4. Implement that ONE story ONLY - DO NOT proceed to other stories
    5. Run checks and tests then remove tests files
    6. Update CLAUDE.md files with learnings
    7. Update README.md for human documentations
    8. Commit using story title and story implementation description
    9. Update stories.yaml with `passes: true` if the implementation is a success
    10. Append learnings to progress.md
    11. STOP HERE - Do not implement any other story in this iteration

    ## Progress Format
    Append to progress.txt:
    ```markdown
    ## [DATE] - [StoryID] - [Story Title]
    - Status of the implementation of this story
    - What was implemented
    - Files changed
    - **Learnings:**
      - Pattern discovered
      - Gotchas encountered
      - Remaining issues (if any)
    ---
    ```

    ## Stop iterations
    If ALL stories pass, reply:
    <promise>COMPLETE</promise>
    Otherwise end normally.
